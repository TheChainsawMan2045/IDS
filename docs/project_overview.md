# Project Overview – Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with LLM Enrichment

This project implements a lightweight intrusion detection workflow designed for the CIS 3370 course.  
It demonstrates a full data pipeline:

1. Collect raw network traffic (CIC IDS dataset sample)
2. Process and transform the data into meaningful alerts
3. Enrich alerts using a Large Language Model (LLM)
4. Forward enriched alerts to Elasticsearch
5. Visualize insights using Kibana dashboards

The goal is to show how traditional IDS methods can be enhanced with AI-driven summarization and risk scoring.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand IDS data formats
- Build an ETL pipeline for security data
- Apply LLM-based summarization and risk scoring
- Configure Elasticsearch/Kibana for ingest & visualization
- Present actionable, user-friendly alerts
