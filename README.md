Project: LLM-Powered Suricata Alert Triage and Summarization
Instructor: Parra
Due Date: December 11

📘 Mission Statement

This project aims to automate intrusion detection alert triage using Suricata alerts, Elasticsearch, and a Large Language Model (LLM). Suricata alert logs are ingested into an ELK Stack environment, enriched using an LLM to generate plain-English summaries, severity ratings, and recommended analyst actions. The goal is to reduce alert fatigue and improve analysis efficiency.
